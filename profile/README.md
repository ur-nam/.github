## About Us
Our laboratory investigates the mechano-transduction of the inner ear â€” how the inner ear selects and amplifies external stimuli. Inner ear sensory cells are called mechanoelectric transducers because they are mechanically stimulated by surrounding soft tissues or fluid to generate electric signals. We focus on the mechanical interaction between inner ear sensory cells and their surrounding structures. Computational and experimental methods are combined for our research. Various engineering and biological principles are incorporated such as structural acoustics, micro-fluidics, microelectromechanical systems, and electrophysiology. The repositories on this space contain published versions of our computational models as well as some of our data acquisition software. We are still in process of making all of our code publicly availabe. If you are interested in using this code, please reach out to us.
